Aya is a programming language _and_ an interactive proof assistant designed for type-directed programming _and_ formalizing math.

The type system of Aya has the following highlights:

+ Set-level cubical features so `funExt` and quotients are available without axioms (like [Agda], [redtt], and [Arend] but not higher-dimensional),
+ Overlapping and order-independent pattern matching,
+ Practical functional programming features similar to [Haskell] and [Idris].

<!-- Aya is under active development. Please be patient until future information is available. -->
