# The Aya Prover

+ [Installation Guide](install)
+ [Tutorial for Haskellers](haskeller-tutorial) (should also work for Idris users)

Aya is a programming language _and_ an interactive proof assistant designed for type-directed programming _and_ formalizing math.

The type system of Aya features in the following:

+ Univalent features similar to Cubical [Agda], [redtt], and [Arend],
+ Overlapping and order-independent pattern matching,
+ Practical functional programming features similar to [Haskell] and [Idris].

<!-- Aya is under active development. Please be patient until future information is available. -->
