# The Aya Prover

Aya is a programming language and a proof assistant designed for formalizing math _and_ type-directed programming.

The type system of Aya features in homotopical features similar to [Arend]
overlapping but confluent pattern matching, and abstraction over definitional equalities.

Aya is under active development. Please be patient until future information is available.

$$ f(x) = a+b $$

$$ \int^a_b f(x)dx $$
